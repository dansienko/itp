i am checking the notes given to me by my intro to programming professor.
I am opening the terminal and navigating to my documents folder, then itp, then haiku.
I am using the `say "hello" -o hello.aiff` line of code.
i have successfully saved my haiku to the correct folder thus completing the assignment.
