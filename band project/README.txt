The first issue was deciding who would do the code, we decided on me. I was glad about this because I have moved on from the child I was in past weeks, only using chatGPT to complete assignments, and I have decided it is time to learn a thing or two. Alicia provided an HTML template that we all liked the style of and I got to work editing it. I found it simple to edit the text to fit our needs, and I copy and pasted the sectiones needed to add more biography sections for the members. I then added images into it using a line of code I had to ask GPT for, which was <img src="my-image.jpg" alt="A cool image">
The last line of code I needed from GPT was to add a hyperlink, which was <a href="https://example.com">Click here</a> . I used this to add a link to find our music, which is actually just a link to a 6 hour phish set. 
After that, I struggled with getting the website actually online. I was able to get it done once I realized that I was not commiting my changes on github desktop properly.

I believe that my contribution to the group was sufficient. I was worried that I would lag behind due to my usual AI dependency, but I did most of the coding for the group and was able to get the website live by myself. Alicia and Bella were extremely helpful in creative decisions and in assisting in the coding process when necessary. They made the features found on the website.
